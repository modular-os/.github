# Modular OS Group of Peking University

This is a starter project in Peking University "GISLAB"(not formal name) aiming to make current monolithic OSes configurable and to enable easy migration of components.

We collaborate at [yuque](https://modular-os.yuque.com) to sync our understandings of the project.
